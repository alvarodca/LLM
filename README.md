AppendixA.ipynb <- Jupyter file with notes on Pytorch basics

chapter02.py, chapter03.py, chapter04.py, chapter05.py <- python file containing a copy of specific functions to implement them easily

model.pth <- First GPT model for inference
model_and_optimizer.pth <- First GPT model for future training
review_classifier.pth <- Classifier model from Chapter 6

gpt_download.py <- File from book to load existing weights

gpt2 <- Loaded trainable weights from GPT2

sms_spam_collection <- contains dataset used for spam classification chapter 6
test.csv, train.csv, validation.csv <- CSV splitted files of the above mentioned folder
