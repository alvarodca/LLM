 Large Language Model from Scratch

This is a project file which follows the reading of Build A Large Language Model from Scratch written by Sebastian Raschka.
The following files are just a summary of the different covered chapters

Files:
Chapter1.ipynb <- Jupyter file with notes on understanding LLMs
Chapter2.ipynb <- Jupyter file with notes on working with text data
Chapter3.ipynb <- Jupyter file with notes on Attention Mechanisms
Chapter4.ipynb <- Jupyter file with notes on implementing the GPT model
Chapter5.ipynb <- Jupyter file with notes on Pretraining on unlabeled data

AppendixA.ipynb <- Jupyter file with notes on Pytorch basics

chapter02.py, chapter03.py, chapter04.py <- python file containing a copy of specific functions to implement them easily

model.pth <- First GPT model for inference
model_and_optimizer.pth <- First GPT model for future training
gpt_download.py <- File from book to load existing weights

gpt2 <- Loaded trainable weights from GPT2
